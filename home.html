      <h1>Happy Accidents Paint Shop</h1>
      <h2>A Bob Ross-themed React App</h2>
    </span>
    <div id="main">
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>It's 2020 – life is stressful. Many people I know are going through a hard time.
        To cheer myself and others up, I decided to create a React app where users can
        do a relaxing, low-stress activity – browse and shop for paints. To make it
        as absolutely chill as possible, I decided to theme my paint shop based on
        Bob Ross's The Joy of Painting. The shop name is based on a well-known quotation
        of his: "We don't make mistakes, just happy accidents!"
      </p>
      <h4>The aesthetic</h4>
      <p>Bob Ross's aesthetic is anti-perfectionist, perhaps a little kitsch. As a result,
        I decided to incorporate very literal aesthetic elements from the show using textured
        backgrounds – the three materials I chose are canvas, cloth, and wood. These represent
        various painting and palette surfaces. Together, they create a collage-like effect,
        which amplifies the element of kitsch while still being playful.
      </p>
      <div class='image-card'>
        <img src='./texture-collage.png' alt='Image showing textures of wood, cloth, and canvas.'/>
        <p>Textured "materials" used in the app.</p>
      </div>
      <p>In addition, I decided to add other playful elements to the UI – for instance, calling the
        cart "Your Palette", allowing users to add or remove one "squeeze of paint" rather
        than a bottle or other more conventional quantity, and adding backgrounds
        to the selected filtering buttons that reflected their functionality:
      </p>
      <div class='image-card'>
        <img src='./paint-filters.png' alt='Image showing colored filters in this React app'/>
        <p>An example of filter backgrounds in the app.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Goal</h4>
      <p>To give users a pleasant, relaxing paint shopping experience through
        good usability and accessibility practices.</p>
      <h3>Usability principles</h3>
      <p>I took into account a number of usability principles in designing this app. Here are just a few:</p>
      <h3>Learnability</h3>
      <p>The app is structured <b>entirely on one page</b>. When the page loads, elements on the bottom are cut off,
      meaning that <b>scrollability is clear.</b></p>
      <p>Each section (such as filters, or the palette) has <b>clear labels</b>. Different sections – such as the cart – are <b>differentiated using various
        backgrounds</b>, to help users easily understand the app structure.</p>
      <p>To help users figure out which elements are clickable, I added a light <b>drop shadow</b> to all buttons or button groups.</p>
      <p>On interaction, filter buttons' backgrounds change color based on the colors they filter (see image above!). This
        change
      adds usability "magic" and gives the user <b>immediate feedback</b> on what each button does.</p>
      <h4>Memorability</h4>
      <p>Many of the same elements which make an app learnable, such as a clear structure and direct
      feedback, make it more memorable as well. The <b>usability "magic"</b> of certain buttons, and the
      <b>playful labeling</b> in "palette" and "adding a squeeze," help the functionality of the app stick
      in users' minds better.</p>
      <h4>Accessibility</h4>
      <p>I checked my app's accessibility using WAVE's accessibility checking extension. There
        are no errors – meaning that <b>contrast is good</b>, and layout is accessible to screen reading
        software. In addition, <b>tab order corresponds directly to the app structure.</b> Finally, the <b>ability
      to undo actions</b> – for example, switching filters back to "all" or removing elements from the cart –
      make the application more accessible overall!</p>

        in a new tab, or access the <a href='https://github.com/shiraab/uiux-development'>Git Repository.</a> </p>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>I've used React before, but this project allowed me to be creative with
        usability principles. In particular, I had lots of fun adding extra interactive
        elements to the UI, and working within a funky theme. Happy painting!
